    <h1>What is open source software?</h1>
    <pre>

	The term "open source" refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.

	Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.

	"Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can

	manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works. Programmers who have access to a computer

	program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.
